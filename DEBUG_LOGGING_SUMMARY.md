# Debug Logging Summary

## What Was Added

I've added simple debug logging to your existing PRIDE MCP server to help you monitor what's happening when the Kubernetes UI queries the services.

## Changes Made

### 1. MCP Server (`mcp_server.py`)
- Added basic logging configuration
- Added startup logging
- Kept your existing structure intact

### 2. PRIDE Archive API (`tools/pride_archive_public_api.py`)
- Added request/response logging for all MCP tool functions
- Added HTTP middleware to log all incoming requests
- Added timing information for performance monitoring
- Added error logging with details

## What You'll See in Logs

When the Kubernetes UI queries your services, you'll now see:

```
üîç MCP Request - Function: fetch_projects, Params: {'keyword': 'cancer', 'page_size': 25}
üåê Making HTTP request to: https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/v3/search/projects
üìã API Parameters: {'keyword': 'cancer', 'pageSize': 25, 'page': 0}
‚úÖ MCP Response - Function: fetch_projects, Duration: 1.234s
```

## How to Use

1. **Deploy normally** - Use your existing GitLab CI/CD pipeline
2. **Check logs** - Use `kubectl logs -n pride-mcp -l app=pride-mcp-server`
3. **Monitor requests** - All UI queries will be logged with timing and details

## Your Original Setup

Your original setup remains unchanged:
- GitLab CI/CD with environment variables and proxy ‚úÖ
- Kubernetes deployment with template variables ‚úÖ
- Multiple services (API, MCP, UI, Analytics) ‚úÖ
- Slack integration ‚úÖ

The only addition is debug logging to help you monitor what's happening.
